# Run unit tests

### 1. Requirements
To run unit tests you must the pytest library have installed (located in the require.txt file).


### 2. Running tests
You can then run all the tests by typing `python -m pytests` in the root folder or in the `tests` folder (whichever you prefer).


### 3. About tests
The project is based on experiments and research so there are not many unit tests. The tests include `tools` functions and auxiliary functions in server.
